### Image Processing with Dask (ImageXD 2017 Tutorial)

This repository contains materials for a short introduction to image processing with Python's Dask library.

#### Prerequisites

The materials are tested under Python 3 and dask 0.13.0. If you have a recent installation of Anaconda Python, you are most probably good to go! If not, make sure the dask package is installed

```
  pip install dask
```
and up-to-date

```
  pip install dask --upgrade
```

Optionally, you can also install a graph visualization package:


```
  pip install graphviz
```
